The mobile gaming market is fiercely crowded — “market saturation is real,” with “over 500,000 mobile
games” vying for attention . Traditional analytics (e.g. app-store top charts) only highlight the giants,
missing the “invisible velocity” of up‑and‑comers . Sensor Tower’s new Game Intelligence
underscores this need: it classifies games into 70+ subgenres and rich descriptors (setting, theme, art
style, etc.) so studios can compare, say, how “Match‑3 puzzle” titles perform in India vs Germany .
Rx Queen goes further: its LLM tagger generates very granular labels (e.g. “Anime Idle RPG” or “Pixel
Art Horror Shooter” ) and tracks real-time rank changes across dozens of markets. Below are five
data‑product concepts that leverage this “AI taxonomist” + “volatility radar” to solve pressing publisher/
developer and investor problems:
1. Emerging Subgenre/Theme Trend Radar
4
Problem: With so many games, promising niches can hide under broad categories. A sudden surge in a
specific subgenre (e.g. anime-themed strategy RPGs) may go unnoticed until it’s too late to pivot.
Developers and publishers can’t afford to pick the wrong niche or miss a rising trend. 
Rx Queen Insight: Rx Queen continuously groups games by its rich tags (subgenre + theme + art style)
and computes a “Trend Momentum Score” for each tag cluster. For example, it might detect that “Sci-Fi
Match-3” games have collectively jumped in rank across multiple countries this week. By comparing rank
deltas within each tag (and across geographies), it flags subgenre/theme combinations that are heating
up. Unlike simple download counts, this velocity-based approach spots surges early. (Sensor Tower’s
classification proves the value of tag-based filters .) 
3
Packaging: An interactive dashboard or automated report lists the top risers: e.g. “Top 5 rising
subgenre/theme combos this week” with their momentum scores. Users can drill into any tag (e.g.
“Pixel-Art Survival RPG”) to see trend lines and leading games. Alerts/notifications highlight when a
niche accelerates beyond a threshold. For example, a weekly “Theme Trend Report” email might warn:
“Idle Puzzle games with a Fantasy theme are up 20% in Korea this month”. 
• 
• 
Deliverable: A proprietary Trend Momentum Index by tag, exposed via an interactive “Trend
Radar” module and email alerts for surging themes/subgenres. 
Insight: Helps studios choose the right niche early and spot rising themes before the
competition. 
2. LiveOps Update Impact Forensics
Problem: Game teams often wonder, “Why did my competitor spike yesterday?” or “Did my update move
the needle?” Standard charts don’t link rank changes to specific live-ops events. Without clarity, teams
can’t fine-tune updates or marketing. 
Rx Queen Insight: Every time a tracked game releases an update, Rx Queen’s system tags the update
(e.g. using scraped release notes or store metadata) and measures rank volatility immediately before
vs. after. It computes a “LiveOps Pulse” (as suggested in our spec ) – essentially correlating “Last
Update Date” with rank jump magnitudes. An LLM can also extract key features from the update text
6

(e.g. “new campaign map”, “collab with Anime IP”) and associate them with the observed lift or drop. For
instance, it might note: “Game A’s Christmas update (added winter skins) coincided with a 5x volatility spike
in US rank.”
Packaging: A Campaign Forensics Dashboard shows, for each game: the timeline of rank, marked by
update events, and the calculated Delta Change. When a spike occurs, the system issues an alert (web/
email) detailing the competitor’s version text snippets and the % rank gain. Developers get an instant
report: “Your competitor Game B jumped +150 positions in Japan after today’s update, likely due to the new
Samurai theme level.” This insight lets teams emulate successful features or diagnose failures.

Deliverable: An “Update Analyzer” tool that flags spikes tied to releases, with contextual tags. 
Insight: Answers “did that update work?” by linking live-ops actions to real-time rank changes
. 
3. Breakout Hit Radar (Next-Top-10 Alerts)
Problem: The current #1 hits get all the attention, but most studios can’t compete there. Instead, they
need to discover “the next breakout hit” before it skyrockets. Games climbing fast from mid-chart (e.g.
rank #300→#50) are invisible to traditional charts. Publishers/scouts need to catch these early. 
Rx Queen Insight: Using rank volatility across 60+ countries, Rx Queen watches high-rank (e.g. 500–50)
games for unusual momentum. It computes a “Breakout Score” from cross-country velocity: games
that climb sharply in multiple markets score high. By comparing against baselines (typical drift), the
system flags emerging hits. Tags further refine the filter (e.g. “only puzzle games that are rising”). For
example, if a hyper-casual game gains 100 ranks in India, Philippines, and Indonesia within 3 days, it’s
likely ready to burst into the top charts globally. 
Packaging: An interactive Hot Games Radar highlights “Emerging Hits” (e.g. a scrolling list or bubble
chart of games with high Breakout Scores, just below the top-50 cutoff). Publishers can subscribe to
Hot-Game Alerts: e.g. “Game X (Casual Puzzle) is surging out of rank 250 in 3 countries”. A weekly “Next
Top 10” report could include analysis of why (tags, markets, possible UA campaigns). This goes beyond
static top lists – it’s a proactive breakout signal.

• 
Deliverable: A real-time Breakout Alert Feed and dashboard (“Radar”) for high-velocity games
in the mid-chart, with country and tag filters. 
Insight: Enables finding hidden gems on the verge of going viral, rather than reacting to
already-top games. 
4. Genre/Theme Health Index (Market Saturation Pulse)
Problem: Investors and publishers want to know if an entire genre or theme is booming or busting. Is
“Merge” games cooling off? Are “Vampire RPGs” still hot or saturated? Store charts can’t answer that for
custom niches. 
Rx Queen Insight: Rx Queen aggregates its detailed tags across all tracked games to create a Genre
Health Index for any category (subgenre/theme/art style). For each tag (e.g. “Anime Strategy 4X”), it
computes metrics like average rank change, volatility distribution, and count of new entrants over time.
A composite Health Score might weight recent rank gains vs. losses. For example, if most “Fantasy
Tower Defense” games are dropping in rank and few new ones debut, the index flags decline. Conversely,
a jump in average rank (and many active titles) signals growth. This can be sliced by country and

combined (e.g. “5G Tech Sci-Fi shooters globally”). Sensors Tower’s Game Intelligence illustrates this
approach for downloads/revenue

; Rx Queen does it for momentum. 
Packaging: A Genre Pulse Dashboard shows a heatmap or list of trending vs. lagging categories.
Investors might see an alert like “THEME ALERT: Anime Shooters down 15% this week ”. A table might
rank all themes by current Health Score. Users can click a theme to see underlying games and their
tags. A scheduled report (e.g. weekly) could list “Top 10 cooling genres” and “fastest-growing genres”.

Deliverable: An interactive Market Health Tracker that visualizes tag-level trends and
saturation (e.g. heatmaps, indices). 
Insight: Provides high-level signals like “Genre X is crashing” or “Theme Y is emerging,” directly
addressing questions like “Is this genre saturated?” .

5. Competitive Landscape Explorer (Game X‑Ray)
Problem: Identifying true competitors and analogous games is hard. Store “Similar Apps” often suggest
only blockbuster titles, missing niche peers. Developers/investors need to see “Who else is in my exact
niche?” and track them. 
Rx Queen Insight: By leveraging its granular tags, Rx Queen builds a similarity graph of games: titles
are “close” if they share many tags (subgenre, theme, art style) and exhibit similar rank trajectories. This
lets us answer queries like “Which games are most similar to [our game] in genre and market behavior?”.
For example, asking “5X Strategy Fantasy RPGs” might return a set of titles all tagged Fantasy, 5X, RPG,
Pixel-Art, even if the stores wouldn’t list them together. Sensor Tower’s “Taxonomy Exploration” hints at
this capability . 
10
Packaging: A Similar Games Report tool where a user enters a reference game or selects a tag cluster.
The tool outputs a ranked list of peers, each annotated with their key tags, recent rank change, and
country performance. It can highlight outliers (e.g. “Game Z is an 80% tag-match and up 30% in rank this
week”). Alerts can notify when any peer spikes (competitor watch). Investors can use this to find
unknown breakout games in a niche; devs use it to map the “hidden market.”

Deliverable: An on-demand Game X‑Ray dashboard (or report) that finds and compares
“similar” games by tag+momentum, with charts and brief insights. 
Insight: Answers “Who else plays in my niche?” with data-driven similar-game mapping,
improving on app-store suggestions .

Each of these solutions leverages Rx Queen’s unique strengths: LLM-enriched tagging and cross-country
rank volatility. For example, the Trend Radar and Genre Health Index exploit the AI taxonomist to drill
down into specific subgenre/theme combinations . The LiveOps Forensics and Breakout Radar
use rapid rank delta analysis (“Volatility Radar”) to surface signals invisible on static charts . And
the X‑Ray Explorer builds on our tagging to create proprietary similarity and momentum indices
beyond what competitors offer . Together, these packaged insights (alerts, dashboards, reports)
deliver actionable intelligence that goes far beyond generic charts – answering the critical questions:
“What niche is heating up?”, “Why did ranks change?”, and “Which games or genres should I watch or
avoid?” .
