# Product Value Maximization: The "Whiteboard Gain" Strategy

## 1. The Core Problem
**"Why would I pay for this?"**
Currently, Rx Queen offers a subset of Data.ai's data with less history. To an investor or publisher, this is not a product; it's a dashboard. To charge for access, we must stop selling *Data* and start selling *Alpha* (Information Advantage).

## 2. The Differentiator: "Expert Taxonomy" (The Moat)
We cannot beat the giants on volume. We beat them on **Classification Resolution**.
SensorTower has "RPG". We have "Turn-Based Sci-Fi RPG with Gacha Mechanics".

### The Execution Strategy
1.  **AI-Assisted Expert Tagging**:
    *   **Input**: Game Description, Screenshots (future), Reviews.
    *   **Process**: Use your expert taxonomy (Genre, Subgenre, Art Style, Monitor Orientation, Gameplay Loop).
    *   **Output**: A "Rich Metadata" layer that no competitor has.
    *   *User Value*: "Show me all *Landscape Mode* *Anime* games that are growing." (Impossible on simple tools).

## 3. Proprietary Metrics (The Revenue Layers)

We will introduce 3 proprietary scores that answer business questions directly.

### A. The "Saturation Index" (Risk Analysis)
*   **Question**: "Should I build a Merge game?"
*   **Formula**: `(Total Daily Downloads of Top 10) / (Number of Apps competing for them)`
*   **Insight**: "Merge games are 'High Saturation'. 10 apps fight for 90% of revenue. Don't enter." vs "Idle RPG is 'Low Saturation'. Long tail games are earning well."
*   **Value**: Saves the user $100k in bad development costs.

### B. The "Indie Goldmine" (Acquisition Scout)
*   **Question**: "Who should I invest in?"
*   **Filter**:
    *   Rank: Top 500 (Not Top 50).
    *   Publisher Size: < 2 Apps.
    *   Rank Velocity: > +20 positions/week.
    *   Update Frequency: High.
*   **Value**: Finds "Sleeping Giants" before the big publishers bid on them.

### C. The "LiveOps Pulse" (Copycat Engine)
*   **Question**: "What are they doing to grow?"
*   **Action**: Correlate "Version Update Text" with "Rank Spikes".
*   **Insight**: "Games that added 'Battle Pass' in the last month saw +15% rank stability."

## 4. The Business Model: "Freemium to Premium"

### Tier 1: The "Hobbyist" (Free)
*   Top 50 Lists.
*   Basic Rank History (7 Days).
*   *Hook*: Sees the "Saturation Score" but blurred out.

### Tier 2: The "Professional" ($49/mo - "No Brainer")
*   **Full Taxonomy Access**: "Search by Art Style".
*   **The "Indie Hunter" Feed**: Daily email of breakout hits.
*   **Full History**: 90+ Days.
*   **Proprietary Scores**: Saturation Index, Opportunity Score.

### Tier 3: The "Enterprise" (Custom)
*   API Access.
*   Raw Data Export.

## 5. Revised Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1: The "Rich Data" Upgrade (Now)**
    *   Implement "Expert Tagging" pipeline (Using LLM or manual rules on scraped text).
    *   Fix the Data Pipeline (Subgenres, History) -- *Already planned*.
2.  **Phase 2: The "Alpha" Scans**
    *   Build the "Saturation Index" dashboard.
    *   Build the "Indie Hunter" dashboard.
3.  **Phase 3: The Paywall**
    *   Gate Phase 2 features behind a "Pro" login.

## Conclusion
We stop building a "Dashboard" and start building a **"Market Scanner"**. The value is not in seeing the list, but in the *filtering capability* that our unique taxonomy provides.
